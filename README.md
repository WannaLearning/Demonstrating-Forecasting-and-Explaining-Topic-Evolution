***A Framework for Demonstrating, Forecasting, and Explaining Topic Evolution by Analyzing Geometrical Motion of Topic Embeddings***

This paper develops a novel topic evolution analysis framework, which we use to demonstrate, forecast, and explain topic evolution from the perspective of the geometrical motion of topic embeddings generated by pretrained language models. Our research framework shows that topic evolution can be analyzed via the geometrical motion of topic embeddings, and the semantic motion of old topics nurtures new topics.

**This repository contains the code to reproduce the reults of our paper:**  
1. Extract_cs_data.py -> collect and preprocess the data from the MAG dataset. (The MAG dataset can be downloaded from https://www.aminer.cn/oag-2-1)
2. vec_by_bert.py -> generate the topic embeddings via BERT model; A decoder is trained to decode a embeddings to fos.
3. vec_by_mpnet.py -> generate the topic embeddings via MPNET model; A decoder is trained to decode a embeddings to fos. (The MPNET model can be downloaded from https://www.sbert.net)
4. Semantic_Movement_Verify.py -> Section 3.2	Demonstrating the motion of topic embeddings via SVM.
5. Semantic_Movement_Predict.py -> Section 3.3 Forecasting motion via vector regression models.
6. Semantic_Movement_Explain.py -> Section 3.4Explaining forecast motion via a text generation model.
